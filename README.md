# Homelab
## Introduction
I purchased an old office PC to use as a Homelab setup with the main purpose of reducing costs associated with common digital services like Google Photos, iCloud, or Spotify. Along the way, it has also helped me solidify my knowledge in DevOps, network administration, and IT deployment.
I would say this project will never be truly complete, as there is always something I want to change, whether it's the storage size or the implementation of more Docker services.  
## Future
One of my plans is to implement a larger storage size, hopefully enabling me to store Blu-Ray-sized movies and stream them over the internet. I also hope to host a Minecraft server for friends to play on.  
## Would i recommend to use UNRAID?
UNRAID is not a safe operating system in terms of an enterprise environment, primarily because everything you run operates mostly as root. It's great for home use as it gets things running quickly. However, if I had to run virtualization in an enterprise setting, I would use Proxmox or ESXi as they are much more secure and reliable.
